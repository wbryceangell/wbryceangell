### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on AnnotatedJS (soon to be an open source project 🤞)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [React Test Driven Development](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-react-test-driven-development-second-edition/9781803247120)
- 💬 Ask me about what I am reading 📖. Usually it consists of a non-fiction book in the technology space and a fiction novel set in a high fantasy universe
- 📫 How to reach me: wbryceangell@gmail.com or devdecaf@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love card games 🃏, especially Magic the Gathering. Send a friend request to `decafdev#17600` if you play [Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena)!
